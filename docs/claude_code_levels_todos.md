---

## Gap Fixes — Critical Issues (from design doc audit)

These items were identified as missing from the original implementation and violate design doc acceptance criteria.

### G.1 Sources page not rendering individual sources (Acceptance Criterion 7)
- [x] Fix `src/templates/pages/sources.html` — render source-card partial for each source within its group (currently only renders group headers)
- [x] Verify rendered sources page shows actual source entries grouped by type

### G.2 Level pages missing Related Dimensions section (Acceptance Criterion 6)
- [x] Add Related Dimensions section to `src/templates/pages/level-detail.html` — render `level.relatedDimensionIds` as links to dimension page
- [x] Look up dimension names from context for display labels

### G.3 Level pages missing Citations section (Acceptance Criterion 6)
- [x] Add Citations section to `src/templates/pages/level-detail.html` — use the existing `citation-list.html` partial with `level.citationIds`
- [x] Resolve citation IDs to source titles/links from sources data

### G.4 Navigation not exposing five levels directly (Design doc requirement)
- [x] Add individual level navigation items to `src/data/site/navigation.json` under familyNav
- [x] Levels should appear as sub-items: Operator, Collaborator, Builder, Engineer, Expert

### G.5 Exercises not linked from level pages
- [x] Add "Exercises" section to `src/templates/pages/level-detail.html`
- [x] Filter exercises by `levelId` matching the current level
- [x] Render exercise title, summary, and difficulty

### G.6 Section anchors for deep linking on level pages
- [x] Add `id` attributes to each section heading on level detail pages (e.g., `id="core-concepts"`, `id="graduation-criteria"`)
- [x] Add in-page section navigation (table of contents) at top of level pages

---

## Gap Fixes — Medium Priority

### G.7 Remaining Phase 4-5 incomplete items
- [ ] Test browser print preview on level page, matrix page, and sources page
- [ ] Test validation fails on deliberately broken input
- [x] Verify site works when served from local static server (`npm run dev`)

### G.8 README gaps
- [ ] Document exercises.json structure and how to add exercises
- [ ] Document citationIds and relatedDimensionIds usage
- [ ] List all validation rules from the design doc

### G.9 Accessibility improvements
- [x] Add skip-to-content link in all layouts
- [x] Add ARIA landmarks (`role="contentinfo"` on footer; `<main id="main-content">` on all layouts; nav already has `aria-label`)

---

## Gap Fixes — Optional / Future

### G.10 Design doc optional features not yet planned
- [ ] Printable summary page (`/ai-coding/claude-code-competence/printable/index.html`)
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle (currently dark only)
- [ ] `npm run watch` for file-change rebuild
